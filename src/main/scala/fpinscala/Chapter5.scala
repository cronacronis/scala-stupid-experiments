/*
	Variadic functions are just providing a little syntactic sugar for creating and passing
	a Seq of elements explicitly. Seq is the interface in Scalaâ€™s collections library imple-
	mented by sequence-like data structures such as lists, queues, and vectors. Inside
	apply, the argument as will be bound to a Seq[A] (documentation at http://mng.bz/
	f4k9), which has the functions head (returns the first element) and tail (returns all
	elements but the first). The special _* type annotation allows us to pass a Seq to a
	variadic method.
